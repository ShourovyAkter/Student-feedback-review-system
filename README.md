# Student-feedback-review-system
Creating a student feedback review system involves various stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The SDLC is a systematic process for planning, creating, testing, deploying, and maintaining software. Here's a general guide on how you can develop a student feedback review system using the SDLC model:

Requirements Gathering (Planning Phase):

Identify stakeholders: Determine who will be using the system, such as students, instructors, and administrators.
Collect and analyze requirements: Understand the functionalities and features needed for the feedback system. Consider aspects like user roles, feedback categories, reporting, and system scalability.
System Design (Design Phase):

Architectural design: Plan the overall structure of the system, including the database schema, user interfaces, and backend components.
Detailed design: Create detailed specifications for each module or component, outlining how they will interact and function.
Implementation (Coding Phase):

Write the code for the feedback system based on the design specifications.
Follow coding standards and best practices to ensure maintainability.
Use version control systems to track changes.
Testing (Testing Phase):

Perform unit testing for individual components to ensure they work as expected.
Conduct integration testing to verify that different modules work together seamlessly.
Perform system testing to evaluate the overall functionality and usability.
Implement user acceptance testing (UAT) to involve end-users in the validation process.
Deployment (Deployment Phase):

Deploy the feedback system to a staging or testing environment.
Conduct final testing to ensure everything works in the production environment.
Roll out the system to the intended users.
Maintenance and Support (Maintenance Phase):

Monitor the system for any issues or bugs.
Provide ongoing support and updates based on user feedback.
Implement new features or improvements as needed.
Feedback Collection and Iteration (Continuous Improvement):

Integrate a mechanism for collecting feedback on the system itself from users.
Use collected feedback to make improvements and address any issues.
Iteratively enhance the system based on the evolving needs of users.
Documentation:

Create comprehensive documentation throughout the SDLC, including requirements documents, design documents, and user manuals.
